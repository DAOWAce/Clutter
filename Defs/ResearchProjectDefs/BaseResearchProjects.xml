While hunting for dead squirrel's ( live ones are to dangerous obviously) one of colonist discover a sponge, but this wasn't any normal sponge it was a PLASMA SPONGE!
So jugging his memory after this event for a quite good while, he discover that his coffee cup is empty.
If this makes no sense it means your not insane enough.

With this research colonist will be able to refill their coffee cups more ofter and learn the way of the spoooonge.

It was cryptic and very long, with its complex shapes all around its white layer. It might even be the ancient Da Vinci code for all he knew. And this passage "Press the red button to increase plasma resonation", it might be it, it might be just what he is looking for.
There was only one obstacle in his way, he couldn't read.
But he knew that he just discovered probably the only manual still in existence, that don't have pictures.

With this research colonist might try to make wigs from plasma sponges.

They did sit in total silence with laser like focus, observing from a safe distance(heavily barricaded room) a group of squirrel's that was skillfully reverse engineering (eating) a body of canepid or raiders corpse pile (it was very far safe distance). Colonist ware amaze by squirrels engineering knowledge so they barricaded themselves more.

With this research colonist will eat squirrel's brains to boost tier engineering knowledge, or faint on sight of squirrel's brains. (There are times when you wish you ware a zombie)

After long debate about meaning of life and squirrel's threat assessment, colonist decided to develop new table types so they don't need to chat so often or in most cases at all.
	
With this research colonist will uncover ancient art of table-fuu.

One to rule them all, One to find them, One to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. 
And so it was decided that every colonist should get his own coffee cup.
	
With this research your colonist wont need to share coffee cups.

While observing Rimworld man-eating bugs, one of the colonist (the one not yet eaten) was bashing that bug with nearest thing he could find (almost fresh squirrel),that got him two ideas.
First idea was to run like hell(squirrel wasn't dead after all), other idea was to make tables stronger just in case that squirrel would want a revenge.
Yes this completely makes no sense!

With this research colonist will construct tables with stronger materials outside out, giving tables extra endurance and better cover abilities.

Modern Tables Bonuses:	
Tables cover up form 30% to 80%.
Tables hit points up from 300 to 450.
